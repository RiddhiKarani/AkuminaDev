### Overview

SharePoint Online (SPO) now offers two models for building sites. Classic SPO sites and Modern SPO sites leveraging the SPFx framework. Presently, there are still significant differences in capability between Classic and Modern – specifically in the arena of brand-ability, customization, third party integration and design output, but the demand or Modern SPO sites is increasing as some customers want to be able to leverage the ‘latest and greatest’.

Akumina, in the upcoming 5.0 release that was announced on May 22, will fully support both models. This allows Akumina to meet the demand of the marketplace for the most recent Microsoft capabilities and offerings, as well as for sites that provide a full featured and immersive and distinct experience, based on Classic SPO sites. Customers will be able to leverage one approach or the other – or in certain circumstances, both at the same time.

Akumina separates Content, from Function, from Presentation. This abstracted approach is what allows for:

* Easy integration with 3rd party systems outside the Microsoft ecosystem
* Easy adaption to a different Microsoft page rendering/compiling engines

Modern Pages and SPFx are not about new ways to manage content, they are about new ways to deliver capabilities into a page and bring that page to an audience.

Akumina’s support of both Microsoft page rendering models is not about creating a ‘new Akumina way of doing things’, rather, it is about adapting the Akumina widget technology to be delivered to an end user through either model – with complete feature parity – following Akumina’s ‘use the right tool for the right job’ deployment approach.

## 2 experiences 

There are two experiences that Akumina Modern supports that determine how pages are authored and how widgets are added. 

## Akumina Page Experience 

In this model, the Akumina Virtual Page Builder is used to construct pages. Visually, the page is similar to its classic site counterpart, yet only Akumina widgets are allowed to be in the pages.

## Modern Page Experience 

In this model, Akumina widgets are delivered in the page, and the Modern editing flow is used – this allows both Akumina widgets and Modern Web Parts to be in the page together.

## All the Akumina Benefits in a Modern Page
With the ease of adding Akumina into SPFx driven pages also comes many of the benefits as well.

Akumina Widget Targeting and Audience Segmentation are still available as those are functions of the Akumina Widgets and don’t have any dependencies on the page technology (in this case SPFx) in which they are hosted.

As well as the same multi-view and management capability for configuring widget properties and easy access content editing.
