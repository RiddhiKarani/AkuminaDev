### Update App Manager CKEditor

The Akumina AppManager uses the [CKEditor](https://ckeditor.com/) for editing content. This editor has several options available for customization.

**NOTE**: Changes made to the edit files are NOT upgrade-friendly and need to be re applied after patches or upgrades.

## CKEditor Documentation

The CKEditor documentation is located at https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/. You can reference the documentation for how to do various customizations.

## File Location

The App Manager editor files are in:

**{AppManager Install path}/Editor/ck**

The Editor files as shown in an FTP client (FileZilla):
