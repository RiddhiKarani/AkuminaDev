Here at Akumina, we know widgets are powerful little tools that can greatly enhance the usability and overall enjoyment of your modern intranet. That's why we're proud to announce the start of an objective to uncover the possibilities of widgets in various frameworks. 

The [Widget Overview](/docs/Akumina-Widgets-Overview) page has just launched, covering widgets in Vanilla Javascript, Typescript, and [React](/docs/Akumina-React-Widgets). Be sure to check out all the awesome things you can do with custom widgets in the Akumina Framework!
